This repository provides an end-to-end exploration of computer vision techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
Starting from foundational methods (SVM, KNN, Softmax) and building up to neural networks with barebone PyTorch and nn.Module, 
the project covers experiments with activation functions, learning rates, optimizers, hidden layer configurations, etc. 
It concludes in transfer learning with fine-tuning and the implementation of Vision Transformers (ViT) with 16x16 patch embeddings from scratch, inspired by the original paper. 
A hands-on journey for both beginners and advanced practitioners!
